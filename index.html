		<h1> The Resort 2021 Collections Delivered Classics, Not Trends</h1>
		<p>The women’s resort season, once an excuse for far-flung destination spectacles, happened largely online this year. The clothes created for lookbooks, videos, and some social-media-based spectacles reflected that reality, giving up the challenging, progressive spirit often seen on runways in favor of something safer, more secure, and—perhaps most importantly—salable. </p>

		<p>The tenor of resort has always been less about experimentation or provocation and more about delivering what customers want. But now that’s true more than ever. Here, there are simple knit house clothes, pastoral dresses that tap into a #cottagecore look, an array of intricate necklines that look nice on Zoom, and even some eveningwear, for those holding out a hope that reasons for dressing up and going out might happen again sometime soon. For those resolute to dress up at home, the most eye-catching idea is a full body of can’t-look-away prints—all the better to catch someone’s eye on social media.</p>

		<p>Still, even if much of this season felt like a rehashing of items and ideas proven to work, there were moments of excitement. “In the darkest moments creativity is so key,” said Bottega Veneta’s Daniel Lee, whose resort collection introduced new circular shapes, cotton and knit materials, and knotting and weaving techniques. “It’s about making clothes you can’t find in other stores,” Lee continued. “Otherwise what’s the point?” Maybe, in the end, innovation will be the most salable thing of all.
